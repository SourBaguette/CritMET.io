  quarumInfo: `QuARUm is the German acronym for “Quality Assessment of Analytical Data in Resource and Environmental Research” (Qualitätsbewertung von Analytikdaten in der Ressourcen- und Umweltforschung). QuARUm is a multidisciplinary research project in cooperation with the Software Engineering research group at TU Dortmund. It started in 2023. The project is funded by the BMBF (German Ministry of Research and Education) in the frame of “Projects to strengthen the data skills of young scientists” (Projekte zur Stärkung der Datenkompetenzen des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses). 

The amount of published biogeochemical data and the number of biogeochemical databases are constantly increasing. However, the quality assessment of literature data is often complicated or even impossible due to the lack of crucial background information. The goal of QuARUm is to develop an easy-to-use software tool that can evaluate the usability and reliability of biogeochemical data. It will help geochemists search for high-quality data that fits their very specific research needs. Furthermore, the software tool enables geochemists to screen their own analytical data and increase their quality. 

The project is a collaboration between the research groups CritMET - Critical Metals for Enabling Technologies at the Constructor University (formerly Jacobs University Bremen) and Software Engineering at the Technical University of Dortmund to jointly develop a low-code software tool that objectively assesses the quality of biogeochemical data using fully modifiable, sample-specific criteria. This evaluation will be applicable to own analytical data, literature data and large biogeochemical databases. The software tool will be designed as an open-box environment that is fully modifiable to suit specific applications and user needs. To ensure ease of use without in-depth programming knowledge, a Domain Specific Language (DSL), which is intuitive and easy to learn for the target audience (biogeochemistry), will be developed in user feedback loops. The high usability of the software tool will be a crucial factor for the research project's success. 
 
The idea for QuARUm came from Malte Mues and David Ernst, who wrote the project proposal and are now working on this project as PostDocs. Malte Mues is a software engineer in the AQUA research group at TU Dortmund. David Ernst is geochemist in the CritMET research group at Constructor University. Both, Malte and David got their PhD degrees in 2023.

  projectInfo: `QuARUm has started, and we are working on the first prototypes. During the next years, we will develop and publish software tools that support researchers in evaluating their analytical data. In geoscientific case studies, we will demonstrate the function of our software. Furthermore, we will organise workshops where we present and discuss our outcomes and provide hands-on instructions on using the software tools.  

  Interaction with and feedback from the geoscience community will be crucial during our project, and therefore, we attended the GeoBerlin 2023 in September. At this national geoscience conference, we presented QuARUm for the first time in public. The feedback and impressions we gathered during the sessions will help us adapt our software to the needs of geochemists.

  davidErnst: `Hey, my name is David, I was born in Wuppertal (Germany), and I studied Geosciences at Ruhr-Universität Bochum (Bachelor) and Economic Geosciences at TU Clausthal (Master). During high school, I had no strong affinity for chemistry. However, that changed, especially during my master's studies in Clausthal, where I investigated trace element distributions in ferromanganese crusts during my master thesis.
                        
    In 2017 I joined the Geochemistry Workgroup at Constructor University, which was back then still called Jacobs University. The first almost two years I worked on a research project, dealing with the processing of ferromanganese nodules (deep-sea ore precipitates). In January 2019 I started my PhD in the CritMET research group of Michael Bau. In my PhD project, we investigated the behaviour of the critical trace elements Gallium and Germanium together with their respective geochemical partners, Aluminium and Silicon, in the natural environment. Our special focus was on Precambrian banded iron formations, which are great archives for past seawater environments. Banded iron formations are quite old (up to ~3 billion years), layered rocks with alternating iron-rich and silica-rich bands.
    
    In July 2023, I successfully finished my PhD and now work as a PostDoc in our CritMET research group. My PostDoc research project is QuARUm, which is a collaboration with the Software Engineering research group at TU Dortmund. QuARUm aims to develop software that supports researchers to assess the quality and suitability of geochemical data with respect to their specific research questions (klick here to read more about QuARUm).`,

  lukasKlose: `Hello, my name is Lukas Klose.  

    I did both my Bachelor and Master in Geoscience at the Ruprecht-Karls University in Heidelberg. This is also where my interest in aquatic geochemistry first started. As my Master thesis project, I had the opportunity to join a sampling to the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, were we investigated bell-shaped calcite structures that, unlike stalactites or stalagmites, form under water in a highly stagnant, stratified water body. 
    
    In January 2019, I started my PhD in the workgroup of Prof. Andrea Koschinsky at Constructor University (back then named Jacobs University). My thesis focused on the geochemical investigation of hydrothermal vent fluids from multiple vent sites within the North-East Lau Basin, SW Pacific Ocean. Submarine hydrothermal systems are closely related to convergent and divergent plate boundaries as well as intra-plate volcanism and hydrothermal activity is typically characterized by the venting of high temperature (up >400°C), anoxic, and metal enriched fluids that can be found in water depths of up to ~5000 m. By investigating the chemical composition of these high-temperature hydrothermal fluids we can infer the effect and occurrence of processes that take place within the hydrothermal circulation cell through the oceanic crust, e.g., magmatic degassing, intensity of water-rock interaction, phase separation or subsurface cooling.  
    
    In April 2023, I defended my PhD and since then work as a PostDoc in Prof. Michael Bau’s research group. Currently, I am working within the EU-funded CRMgeothermal project which aims to combine the extraction of raw materials as well as heat/energy production from geothermal systems. My main research focus is the geochemical investigation of geothermal fluids from various (geological/tectonic) locations (western Anatolia, Türkiye; East-African Rift – Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania; United Downs, UK; Iceland) and their potential of transporting critical raw materials such as Rare Earth Elements.

  addisKokeb: `I, Addis Kokeb Alemu, am a passionate researcher with a background in Chemistry, holding a B. Ed in Chemistry with minor in Mathematics from Bahir Dar University, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Subsequently, I pursued an MSc in Analytical Chemistry at Bahir Dar University and joined the Department of Chemistry, College of Natural and Computational Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia, which granted me a study leave to pursue my current PhD program. My academic journey led me to receive the prestigious C V Raman International Fellowship for African Researchers, where I conducted collaborative research focusing on the removal of Cr (VI) through biosorption. This enriching experience involved a three-month training period at the Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG), Assam, India.

    Then, I did my second European Joint master’s in quality in Analytical Laboratories (EMQAL) under the Erasmus Mundus Program. After completing the course work at University of Algarve, Faro, Portugal, I joined the University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain for one full year research work. I conducted research entitled “LC-MS/MS method development for analysis of pesticides in different food commodities” at Public Health Agency of Barcelona, Spain in collaboration with University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.
    
    Currently, I am part of Prof. Dr. Michael Bau Geochemistry Research Group at School of Science, Constructor (formerly Jacobs) University Bremen, Germany, where I aim to further enhance my research insights and establish enduring partnerships between institutions, particularly with my home University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia. This opportunity arose through the interdisciplinary PANORAMA project within the Marie Curie Actions Innovative Training Network. This exceptional initiative combines diverse components, encompassing training, fieldwork, experimental analyses, and the utilization of innovative research tools focused on Rare Earth Elements (La: Z= 57 to Lu: Z=71) and Yttrium (Y:39), collectively known as ‘REY’, environmental transfer from rocks to human. This project has a pivotal aspect of collaborative engagement with researchers from academic and non-academic sectors, fostering the development of comprehensive research skills necessary to thrive as an independent investigator.
    
    I am researching the quantification and cataloging of geogenic and anthropogenic levels and sources of REY in various forms (dissolved, truly dissolved, nanoparticulate colloidal) in major European rivers and lakes as emerging contaminants. An integral objective of this work is the establishment of a geogenic baseline while scrutinizing the transfer of anthropogenic REY into drinking water sources. I am committed to contribute substantively to this crucial area of study, fostering a deeper understanding of the environmental implications associated with these elements in aquatic ecosystems.
    
    I aim to excel in environmental sciences, using advanced analytical chemistry to address emerging contaminants threatening ecological systems and human health. I will continue further investigations in this direction to enhance our understanding of REY and other emerging contaminants environmental behavior, ecological implications, Risk analysis, and contribute to strategies for managing their impact on ecosystems and human health.`,
