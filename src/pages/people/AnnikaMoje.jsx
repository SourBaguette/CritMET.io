                    <p>Hey, my name is David, I was born in Wuppertal (Germany), and I studied Geosciences at Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum (Bachelor) and Economic Geosciences at TU Clausthal (Master). During high school, I had no strong affinity for chemistry. However, that changed, especially during my master's studies in Clausthal, where I investigated trace element distributions in ferromanganese crusts during my master thesis.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In 2017 I joined the Geochemistry Workgroup at Constructor University, which was back then still called Jacobs University. The first almost two years I worked on a research project, dealing with the processing of ferromanganese nodules (deep-sea ore precipitates). In January 2019 I started my PhD in the CritMET research group of Michael Bau. In my PhD project, we investigated the behaviour of the critical trace elements Gallium and Germanium together with their respective geochemical partners, Aluminium and Silicon, in the natural environment. Our special focus was on Precambrian banded iron formations, which are great archives for past seawater environments. Banded iron formations are quite old (up to ~3 billion years), layered rocks with alternating iron-rich and silica-rich bands.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In July 2023, I successfully finished my PhD and now work as a PostDoc in our CritMET research group. My PostDoc research project is QuARUm, which is a collaboration with the Software Engineering research group at TU Dortmund. QuARUm aims to develop software that supports researchers to assess the quality and suitability of geochemical data with respect to their specific research questions (klick here to read more about QuARUm).
